    <h1> About this project </h1>
   This webpage was created by Daniel Bieckmann, and is part of a thesis project focused on exploring local agency over energy in the municipality of Amsterdam (The Netherlands). This webpage consists of three main elements. Firstly, there is the website's home page, with the interactive Amsterdam Energy Collective Map, that allows user of the platform to see what initiatives are currently active in the city, and which specific (local and city-wide) goals these actors are addressing. Furthermore, the platform provides an overview of which actors are working towards which concrete goals. Secondly, this webpage provides basic information on the energy system in Amsterdam, including emisison information, municipal energy transition goals, and an overview of the Energy Infrastructure of the City. Lastly, there is a calendar that shows any upcoming events, meetings, or deadlines.
